# SeeImgPbg: Image Captioning for Tourist Attractions in Purbalingga

A web-based application that utilizes a custom image captioning model to generate descriptive captions for images of tourist attractions in Purbalingga. The model is built using **ResNet50** for feature extraction and **Transformer algorithms** for generating captions. Integrated with a text-to-speech feature, the system also reads the captions aloud.
